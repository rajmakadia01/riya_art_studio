            <h3>What is Texture Art?</h3>
            <p>
              Texture Art is a unique form of artistic expression that adds depth and dimension to paintings and
              sculptures. By incorporating various materials like sand, fabric, plaster, and acrylic pastes,
              texture art creates a tactile experience that enhances visual appeal. Every brushstroke and
              layered detail adds character, making each piece truly one-of-a-kind.
            </p>
            <p>
              This art form invites viewers not just to see, but to feel the artwork, engaging the senses on a deeper level.
              Artists often use tools like palette knives, sponges, or even their hands to build layers and create dramatic
              surface effects. Whether rough or smooth, raised or indented, the textures evoke emotion, movement, and realism
              in ways that flat surfaces cannot.
            </p>
            <p>
              Texture Art can be both abstract and realistic, allowing for bold experimentation or subtle depth.
              It is commonly used in modern and contemporary art to break the monotony of traditional flat canvases,
              turning ordinary spaces into immersive experiences. From minimalist reliefs to richly layered compositions,
              texture art redefines how we interact with visual media.
            </p>
